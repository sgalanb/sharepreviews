        such account, a &quot;Third-Party Account&quot;) by either: (1)
        providing your Third-Party Account login information through the
        Services; or (2) allowing us to access your Third-Party Account, as is
        permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use
        of each Third-Party Account. You represent and warrant that you are
        entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to us
        and/or grant us access to your Third-Party Account, without breach by
        you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the
        applicable Third-Party Account, and without obligating us to pay any
        fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by the
        third-party service provider of the Third-Party Account. By granting us
        access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that (1) we may
        access, make available, and store (if applicable) any content that you
        have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (the

        Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that
        you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable
        information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available
        on and through your account on the Services. Please note that if a
        Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or our
        access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party
        service provider, then Social Network Content may no longer be available
        on and through the Services. You will have the ability to disable the
        connection between your account on the Services and your Third-Party
        Accounts at any time. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
        THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS

        PROVIDERS. We make no effort to review any Social Network Content for
        any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality, or
        non-infringement, and we are not responsible for any Social Network
        Content. You acknowledge and agree that we may access your email address
        book associated with a Third-Party Account and your contacts list stored
        on your mobile device or tablet computer solely for purposes of
        identifying and informing you of those contacts who have also registered
        to use the Services. You can deactivate the connection between the
        Services and your Third-Party Account by contacting us using the contact
        information below or through your account settings (if applicable). We
        will attempt to delete any information stored on our servers that was

        These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
        the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
        agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise
        or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate
        as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the
        fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our
        rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be
        responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act
        caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
        part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful,
        void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
        deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity
        and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
        venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between
        you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You
        agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue
        of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
        have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of
        signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
