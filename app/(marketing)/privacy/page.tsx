        9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
        <br />
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting

        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
        notice.

        material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by
        prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you
        a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice
